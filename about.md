Hi, my name is Eric. I'm currently working at UCSF, developing an application to make 3D models of white matter tracts. Previously, I worked on an algorithm for quantifying blood flow in Doppler OCT images (currently working on the paper - will post published paper later!). On the side, I enjoy tinkering with web content and sometimes doing absolutely nothing.
